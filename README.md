# 🎮 **Console and PC Gaming Industry: Historical Market Analysis (1980–2020)**

This project provides a Tableau-based analysis of the console and PC gaming industry, using historical data to uncover long-term trends in sales, genre evolution, and platform performance. The goal is to understand the economic and behavioral forces that shaped the industry over four decades and to provide insights relevant for developers, publishers, and investors.

## 🎯 **Project Purpose**

The primary objective of this project is to conduct a **historical and data-driven analysis** of the global console and PC video game market. By examining sales, platforms, and genres, the dashboard highlights:

- 📈 **Drivers of commercial success**
- 🎭 **Shifts in player preferences**
- 🌍 **Regional differences in market performance**
- 🕹️ **Long-term platform cycles and industry evolution**

Annualized sales were used to remove the time-on-market advantage of older titles, enabling fair cross-year comparisons.

## 📊 **Visualizations**

### 📍 **1. Regional Market Growth Over Time**

A line graph comparing global sales trends across North America, Europe, Japan, and Other regions from 1980–2020.

**Key Insight:**  
North America and Europe dominate during the mid-2000s, driven by consoles like the PS2, Nintendo Wii, and Xbox 360. The sharp decline after 2016 reflects a shift toward digital/mobile distribution and reduced reporting of physical sales, not a drop in gaming demand.

### 📍 **2. Evolution of Global Annualized Sales by Genre (Animated)**

An animated visualization showing how global annualized sales evolved across game genres year by year.

**Key Insight:**  
Sales were evenly spread in early years, but clear leaders emerged over time. Sports titles peaked around 2006 with FIFA and Madden, while Action games surged by 2008 with major franchises like Call of Duty and GTA. RPGs and Shooters show steady, long-term engagement and dedicated fan bases.

### 📍 **3. Platform vs Genre Performance (Heatmap)**

A heatmap comparing how major gaming platforms perform across genres, based on annualized global sales.

**Key Insight:**  
PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo platforms show the strongest performance in Action, Shooter, and Sports games. Older platforms appear lighter due to lower sales volumes or limited genre catalogs. The visualization highlights how hardware capabilities shape genre success.

---

### 📍 **4. Gaming’s Generational Curve**

A dual-axis chart showing global sales (lines) and number of releases (dots) for each major console over time.

**Key Insight:**  
Consoles follow a **7–8 year lifecycle**, with clear peaks for PS2 (~2003), PS3 (~2008), PS4 (~2016), and PS5 beginning its rise around 2020. This pattern illustrates the recurring cycle of growth, saturation, and reinvention in the gaming industry.
